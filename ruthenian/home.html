            <h1>The Ruthenian Languages</h1>
            <p>
                The word 'Ruthenia' comes from Latin, and historically referred
                to all Eastern Slavs. In the modern day this would encompass
                Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Rusyns, and we can refer
                to them collectively as 'Ruthenians'. Ruthenians have languages
                which are all very similar to each other, and mutual
                intelligibility is very high. Traditionally the Ruthenians use
                variations of the Cyrillic alphabet to write their languages,
                but there have been times during which a Ruthenian language was
                written in a Latin derived alphabet, typically Polish.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the modern day, usage of the Latin alphabet is very important
                for the success of a language. The Latin alphabet is the most
                fundamental script for computers, with the ASCII standard
                encompassing only the Latin script. The prevalence of English in
                science and as the global language means that many new words
                which are introduced into Ruthenian languages are introduced
                from English, a language using the Latin script. Words can be
                loaned more easily and in a cleaner fashion if languages use the
                same script. Using the Latin script would help Ruthenia progress
                technologically and integrate better into the West and progress
                technologically.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other Slavic languages already use the Latin script but with
                diacritics. Diacritics are not good for computers because they
                require using language encodings other than ASCII. Within
                Unicode, glyphs which are visually the same, can have different
                code points, meaning that during text processing they can be
                confused. This is important when training AI or doing other NLP
                work, as it can significantly worsen results if not properly
                accounted for. In my personal experience, when texting on a
                phone or writing on a keyboard, having to add diacritics can
                significantly slow down my typing speed. And in programming
                languages, rarely do they allow for characters with diacritics
                to be used for the code. These various examples demonstrate that
                even when using a Latin script, adding diacritics can hamper
                technological adoption.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus I propose a Latin script for the Ruthenian languages which
                has no diacritics. It is inspired by the Polish alphabet, the
                Serbo-Croatian Latin script, and my observations of how
                Ruthenian netizens type. To learn more about the proposed
                alphabet and rules of orthography, please visit the page

                of the alphabet is reproduced here for visibility and
                convenience.
